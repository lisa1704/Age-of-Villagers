# Age of Villagers
This repository is detail of a Design Patterns Assignment for SWE 17.  

You need to build part of a game named _Age of Villagers (AoV)_. The game is about people from different parts of the world trying to build their villages.

The detail requirments are in the issues of the repository. Please go through all the 

## Minimum requirements
Without the followings, your assignment will be considered unsubmitted
1. Minimum 16 commits to your repository. The more the better.
2. The commit messages describe what has been done in this.
3. Complete the "level 1" tickets.
4. Maintain the constraints mentioned here: #2.

## Nice to have
The followings are considered "good" and will add some bonus to your submission. You may try some of these if cannot achieve all.
1. At least 64 commits. This is not much, if you commit right way.
2. Tag your commit with a issue. Use this format for tagging: #issue-number. For example #512.
3. There is a special issue (#1) for refactoring commits. Make sure you use this tag when refactoring.

## Overview
The game has a lot of features, of which you need to focus only on the village creation part. Therefore all the user stories are assumed to be of a _village editor_ user role.

A village can have sevaral types of objects like: _house_, _tree_ and _water source_. There are also several nations available. Based on the nation, the objects may look different. For example, house of the Inuits can be an igloo, whereas house of the Bedouin can be a tent.

## Notes
Some parts of the assignment may be changed later. If that happens, you will be notified about it.
